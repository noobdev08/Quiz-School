Â  { q: "A crucial rule for drawing flowcharts is that every decision point (Diamond symbol) should have how many distinct outcomes?", options: ["Exactly one outcome.", "One or two outcomes.", "Two or more distinct outcomes.", "Exactly four outcomes."], answer: "Two or more distinct outcomes." },
Â   { q: "What disadvantage is associated with using flowcharts for certain modern programming techniques, such as **recursive programming**?", options: ["They lack the necessary process symbol.", "They are not well-suited due to their simplicity and sequential nature.", "They cannot be used with the decision symbol.", "They require proprietary software for creation."], answer: "They are not well-suited due to their simplicity and sequential nature." },
Â  { q: "The concept of an algorithm is that the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps, making it easier for the programmer to convert it into:", options: ["A high-level design document.", "An executable computer program.", "A user requirements specification.", "A complex mathematical model."], answer: "An executable computer program." },
Â  { q: "In the algorithm writing process, defining the **variables** is important because it allows the algorithm to be used for more than one case, promoting:", options: ["Debugging.", "Reusability.", "Efficiency.", "Finiteness."], answer: "Reusability." },

Â  { q: "What is the key difference between the **Selection (Branching)** and **Iteration (Loop)** control structures?", options: ["Selection must use the `IF` keyword, while Iteration must use `FOR`.", "Selection executes one of two paths once, while Iteration repeats a block of steps.", "Selection is represented by a Process box, while Iteration uses a Decision diamond.", "Selection is language-dependent, while Iteration is not."], answer: "Selection executes one of two paths once, while Iteration repeats a block of steps." },
Â  { q: "If a designer is working on a project with frequent requirement changes, constantly updating the flowchart can become a **time-consuming and cumbersome** task. This highlights which limitation?", options: ["Limited detail and nuance.", "Can become overly complex.", "Difficult to alter the flowchart.", "Lack of communication tool."], answer: "Difficult to alter the flowchart." },
