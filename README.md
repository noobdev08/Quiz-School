# 🎓 Quiz-School

A simple web quiz app I built for my coursemates to prepare for our 100 level second semester exams.  
Made with plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no backend, just pure vibes and logic 😎

## 📝 Background

Quiz-School started as a partially AI-generated project created by a friend. The initial version had some bugs and an unfinished UI, so I took over to debug, refine, and deploy it.  

This allowed me to:
- Understand and work with unfamiliar code.
- Improve the UI and interactivity using AI-assisted suggestions.
- Deploy the project so it could be used by coursemates.

This project showcases my **problem-solving skills, adaptability, and ability to transform a rough starter into a fully functional app**.
